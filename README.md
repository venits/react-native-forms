## Installation
```js
npm install native-forms --save
// or
yarn add native-forms
```
## Basic Usage
1. Import component.
```js
import NativeForms from 'native-forms';
```
2. Use this component in your **render()** method.
```js
<NativeForms  
  form="https://my.nativeforms.com/vVDct0mcvZWPmZic4JlRvpmNy0Db"  
/>
```

  This code will display form in your application. Replace **form prop** with your form's address. You can create your own forms [here](https://app.nativeforms.com).

## Full Example

Basic flow of **NativeForms** in your application.

```js
import React, {useState} from 'react';  
import { Button, StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';  
import NativeForms from 'native-forms';  
  
const App = () => {  
  const [hasForm, showForm] = useState(false);  
  const show = () => showForm(true);  
  const hide = () => showForm(false);  
  
  return (  
    <View style={styles.container}>  
      <Text>NativeForms.com</Text>  
	  
      <Button title="Show Form" onPress={show} color="#20f" />  
	  
      {hasForm && (  
    	<NativeForms  
      	  form="https://my.nativeforms.com/vVDct0mcvZWPmZic4JlRvpmNy0Db"  
      	  onClose={hide}  
     	/>
      )}
    </View>  
  );
};  
  
const styles = StyleSheet.create({  
  container: {  
    flex: 1,  
    backgroundColor: '#fff',  
    alignItems: 'center',  
    justifyContent: 'center',  
  },
 });  
  
export default App;
```
Replace **form prop** with your form's address. You can create your own forms [here](https://app.nativeforms.com).

| **onBeforeSend**   | Function | No | Called before sending form. Can be used to provide extra data based on user's input.               |
| **noInternetConnection**   | Function | No | Called when user tries to send a form but is offline. Can be used for [offline forms](#offline-forms).              |
| **email**   | String | No | Email of person that will complete form (it will be displayed in the admin panel).                                   |

Example of using props:
```js
<NativeForms  
  form="https://my.nativeforms.com/vVDct0mcvZWPmZic4JlRvpmNy0Db"
  onSend={formData => console.log("Completed form data", formData)}  
  onClose={() => console.log("User cancels forms")}
  onBeforeSend={formData => {   
    //extra data that will be added to form
    return {  
      "Account Type": "Free" 
    };  
  }}
  name="John Smith"
  email="customer@gmail.com"
  extraData={{
    "Account Type": "Premium"
  }}
/>
```

## File Upload for React Native

Uploading files for React Native is a little bit tricky.

If you are using [Expo](https://expo.io/) you have to add this component: [https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/webview/](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/webview/)

**Adding it is as simple as running this command:**
```js
expo install react-native-webview
```

------

If you created your project with [React Native Cli](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli) you need to install this library:

[https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview)

**It is as simple as running those 2 commands:**
```js
npm install --save react-native-webview
// and
react-native link react-native-webview
```

### File Upload - code example

```js
import React, { useState } from "react";  
import { Button, StyleSheet, Text, View } from "react-native";  
import { NativeFormsWebView } from "native-forms";  
import { WebView } from "react-native-webview";  
  
const App = () => {  
  const [hasForm, showForm] = useState(false);  
  const show = () => showForm(true);  
  const hide = () => showForm(false);  
  
  return (  
    <View style={styles.container}>  
      <Text>NativeForms.com</Text>  
  
      <Button title="Show Form" onPress={show} color="#20f" />  
  
      {hasForm && (  
        <NativeFormsWebView onClose={hide}>  
          <WebView  
            source={{  
              uri: "https://my.nativeforms.com/AdnJHOt0mcvZWPmZic4JlRvpmNy0Db"  
            }}  
          />
        </NativeFormsWebView>  
      )}
    </View>  
  );
};  
  
const styles = StyleSheet.create({  
  container: {  
    flex: 1,  
    backgroundColor: "#fff",  
    alignItems: "center",  
    justifyContent: "center"  
  }  
});  
  
export default App;
```

**That's all :)**

## Offline Forms

It can happen that user is offline while completing the form.
NativeForms gives option to send form later when user is back online.
The best way to understand how to use forms offline is by looking at the snippet below.

### Offline Forms - code example
```js
import React, { useState } from "react";  
import { Button, StyleSheet, Text, View } from "react-native";  
import NativeForms, { sendCompletedForm } from "native-forms"; // must be version >= 1.1.4  
  
// must be JSON object exported from Dashboard  
const OFFLINE_FORM = {/* label: 'Offline Form'... */};  
  
const App = () => {  
  const [savedForm, updateSavedForm] = useState(null);  
  const [hasForm, showForm] = useState(false);  
  const show = () => showForm(true);  
  const hide = () => showForm(false);  
  
  const sendSavedForm = async () => {  
    if (savedForm) {  
      await sendCompletedForm(savedForm);  
      console.warn("Form sent successfully");  
    } else {  
      console.warn("No saved form to send");  
    }
  };
  
  return (  
    <View style={styles.container}>  
      <Text>Offline forms test</Text>  
  
      <Button title="Show Form" onPress={show} color="#20f" />  
      <Button title="Send Saved Form" onPress={sendSavedForm} />  
  
      {hasForm && (  
        <NativeForms  
	  formJSON={OFFLINE_FORM}  
          onClose={hide}  
          noInternetConnection={formJSON => {  
            updateSavedForm(formJSON);  
            return true; // yes, I will send form once user is online  
            // return false; <- No, don't send a thing
	  }}
        />
      )}
    </View>  
  );
};  
  
const styles = StyleSheet.create({  
  container: {  
    flex: 1,  
    backgroundColor: "#fff",  
    alignItems: "center",  
    justifyContent: "center"  
  }  
});  
  
export default App;
```
