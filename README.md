## Installation
```js
npm install native-forms --save
// or
yarn add native-forms
```
## Basic Usage
1. Import component.
```js
import NativeForms from 'native-forms';
```
2. Use this component in your **render()** method.
```js
<NativeForms  
  form="https://my.nativeforms.com/vVDct0mcvZWPmZic4JlRvpmNy0Db"  
/>
```

  This code will display form in your application. Replace **form prop** with your form's address. You can create your own forms [here](https://app.nativeforms.com).

## Full Example

Basic flow of **NativeForms** in your application.

```js
import React, {useState} from 'react';  
import { Button, StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';  
import NativeForms from 'native-forms';  
  
const App = () => {  
  const [hasForm, showForm] = useState(false);  
  const show = () => showForm(true);  
  const hide = () => showForm(false);  
  
  return (  
    <View style={styles.container}>  
      <Text>NativeForms.com</Text>  
	  
      <Button title="Show Form" onPress={show} color="#20f" />  
	  
      {hasForm && (  
    	<NativeForms  
      	  form="https://my.nativeforms.com/vVDct0mcvZWPmZic4JlRvpmNy0Db"  
      	  onClose={hide}  
     	/>
      )}
    </View>  
  );
};  
  
const styles = StyleSheet.create({  
  container: {  
    flex: 1,  
    backgroundColor: '#fff',  
    alignItems: 'center',  
    justifyContent: 'center',  
  },
 });  
  
export default App;
```
Replace **form prop** with your form's address. You can create your own forms [here](https://app.nativeforms.com).

Example of using props:
```js
<NativeForms  
  form="https://my.nativeforms.com/vVDct0mcvZWPmZic4JlRvpmNy0Db"
  onSend={formData => console.log("Completed form data", formData)}  
  onClose={() => console.log("User cancels forms")}
  onBeforeSend={formData => {   
    //extra data that will be added to form
    return {  
      "Account Type": "Free" 
    };  
  }}
  name="John Smith"
  email="customer@gmail.com"
  extraData={{
    "Account Type": "Premium"
  }}
/>
```

## File Upload for React Native

Uploading files for React Native is a little bit tricky.

If you are using [Expo](https://expo.io/) you have to add this component: [https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/webview/](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/webview/)

**Adding it is as simple as running this command:**
```js
expo install react-native-webview
```

------

If you created your project with [React Native Cli](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli) you need to install this library:

[https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview)

**It is as simple as running those 2 commands:**
```js
npm install --save react-native-webview
// and
react-native link react-native-webview
```

### Full code example

```js
import React, { useState } from "react";  
import { Button, StyleSheet, Text, View } from "react-native";  
import { NativeFormsWebView } from "native-forms";  
import { WebView } from "react-native-webview";  
  
const App = () => {  
  const [hasForm, showForm] = useState(false);  
  const show = () => showForm(true);  
  const hide = () => showForm(false);  
  
  return (  
    <View style={styles.container}>  
      <Text>NativeForms.com</Text>  
  
      <Button title="Show Form" onPress={show} color="#20f" />  
  
      {hasForm && (  
        <NativeFormsWebView onClose={hide}>  
          <WebView  
            source={{  
              uri: "https://my.nativeforms.com/AdnJHOt0mcvZWPmZic4JlRvpmNy0Db"  
            }}  
          />
        </NativeFormsWebView>  
      )}
    </View>  
  );
};  
  
const styles = StyleSheet.create({  
  container: {  
    flex: 1,  
    backgroundColor: "#fff",  
    alignItems: "center",  
    justifyContent: "center"  
  }  
});  
  
export default App;
```

**That's all :)**
